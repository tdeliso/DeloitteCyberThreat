# DeloitteCyberThreat
Write-ups for Deloitte's 2019 Cyber Threat Competition. I was able to solve 4/5 of the challenges, with #4 being the only one I could not successfully crack. I was able to openssl decrypt the encrypted file, and ended with a POSIX Tar file. From here, I was not able to extract the flag, however.

An additional note is that the flag for #5 is not 100% accurate (I am doing it from memory since apparently I didnt write it down when I first got it, and I don't feel like redownloading the Android emulator and doing that last step again).
